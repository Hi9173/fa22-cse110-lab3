                    Those teams are <strong>RNG</strong> with <em>Xiaohu</em> as their star player, 
                    <strong>GenG</strong> with <em>Ruler</em> as their star player, and <strong>G2</strong>
                    with <em>Caps</em> as their star player. We left off at discussing what are the other
                    possible competitors of the Championship as well.
